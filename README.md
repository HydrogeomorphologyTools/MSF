# MSF (Modified Single Flow) Debris Flow Hazard Assessment Tool

![MSF Logo](assets/image.jpg)

**MSF (Modified Single Flow)** is a regional-scale GIS-based tool designed for the assessment of debris-flow runout zones and susceptibility. By leveraging Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) and initiation points, the software simulates the lateral spreading and deposition of mass movements with high computational efficiency.

## 🚀 Key Features
*   **Regional Batch Processing:** Handle thousands of initiation points efficiently using multiprocessing.
*   **Flexible Inputs:** Supports both Shapefiles (point/polygon) and Raster data for initiation zones.
*   **Automated Pre-processing:** Integrated pit-filling and flow direction calculation via direct WhiteboxTools integration.
*   **Resampling Engine:** Built-in DTM resampling with median/mean/bilinear aggregation methods.
*   **Dual Interface:** Full Graphical User Interface (PyQt5) for interactive use and a Command Line Interface (CLI) for headless/automated workflows.
*   **Standalone Executable:** Fully portable version available in Releases (no Python installation required).

## 🛠 Usage & Detailed Guide

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)
Simply run the standalone executable or run from source:
```bash
python main.py
```

#### 1. Inputs Tab
*   **Base DTM**: The elevation model (GeoTIFF) used for all topographic calculations.
*   **Initiation Points**: 
    *   **Shapefile**: Points or Polygons. The software extracts pixel locations from these geometries.
    *   **Raster**: Binary or weighted raster where cells > 0 are treated as sources.
*   **Optional Overrides**: Toggle "Use External" to provide your own pre-filled DTMs or D8 Flow Directions. If toggled, the engine will skip its internal calculation steps for these files.
*   **PQ_LIM Filename**: Custom name for the final hazardous zone output.

#### 2. Processing Tab
*   **Pit Filling**: Hydrologically corrects the DTM. Using **WhiteboxTools (Wang & Liu)** is highly recommended for accuracy.
*   **Flow Direction**: Calculates the steepest path.

#### 3. MSF Model Parameters
*   **H/L Threshold**: Defines the runout stopping condition ($L$ is distance, $H$ is vertical drop). `0.19` is a common default for regional assessments.
*   **Max Slope**: Threshold for flow initiation.
*   **Direction Aware Uphill**: Adds physical consistency by preventing flow paths from reversing direction sharply.
*   **Direct Distance H/L**: Toggle between Euclidean (straight line) vs. Along-Path distance for the $H/L$ calculation.

#### 4. Resampling & Parallel
*   **Resampling**: Convert high-res DTMs (e.g., 1m) to regional scales (e.g., 5m or 10m) to drastically reduce processing time.
*   **Parallel Processing**: Assign multiple CPU cores. For regional maps with >1000 sources, using 8-16 workers provides significant speedups.

## 🚀 Command Line Interface (CLI)
For automated tasks or server-side execution:
```bash
# Run with a saved configuration
MSF_Regional_Unified.exe --config my_settings.json

# Dump a template to edit
MSF_Regional_Unified.exe --dump-config template.json
```

## ⚙️ Requirements (for Source)
If running from source, you need Python 3.10+ and the following libraries:
*   `rasterio`
*   `numpy`
*   `geopandas`
*   `PyQt5` (for GUI)
*   `whitebox` (Python wrapper for pre-compiled binary)

---

## 📦 Compilation
To build your own standalone executable:
1.  Place the `whitebox_tools.exe` binary in the `WBT/` folder.
2.  Run PyInstaller:
```bash
pyinstaller --clean msf_standalone.spec
```
